# MediaPipe Efficiency Analysis Project

This project focuses on extracting features using MediaPipe, training models, and analyzing their efficiency.

## Project Overview

This repository contains tools for extracting features using MediaPipe, training models on these features, and analyzing the efficiency of various approaches. The project aims to evaluate and optimize the performance of MediaPipe-based feature extraction and model training.

## Repository Contents

- `extract_features_mediapipe.py`: Script for extracting features using MediaPipe
- `train_model.py`: Script for training machine learning models on the extracted features
- `test_mediapipe.py`: Script for testing MediaPipe functionality
- `analyze_efficiency.py`: Script for analyzing the efficiency of the MediaPipe implementation
- `efficiency_report.md`: Report documenting the efficiency analysis findings

## Installation
bash
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dependencies

- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Feature Extraction

To extract features using MediaPipe:
bash
python extract_features_mediapipe.py --input_dir /path/to/input --output_dir /path/to/output

### Model Training

To train models on the extracted features:
bash
python train_model.py --features /path/to/features --model_output /path/to/save/model

### Testing MediaPipe

To test the MediaPipe functionality:
bash
python test_mediapipe.py

### Efficiency Analysis

To analyze the efficiency of the implementation:
bash
python analyze_efficiency.py --input /path/to/data


## Results

Analysis results are stored in the `analysis_results` directory and are not included in the repository. The efficiency report (`efficiency_report.md`) provides a summary of the findings.

## Large Files

Large files related to efficiency selection are stored in the `efficiency-sleected large files` directory and are excluded from the repository. The `efficiency-selected.zip` file is also excluded from version control.
